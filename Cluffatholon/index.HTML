    <div class='info-hover'>
      <p class='hover-info' id='jeff-info'> Jeff is an attorney at Faddoul, Cluff, Hardy, and Conway. The El Paso Native is known for his fierce competitiveness and love for chili. Jeff hopes to take it all this year after a disappointing performance in Cluffathalon 2020, but most bettors have him taking 3rd. </p>
      <p class='hover-info' id='nicole-info'> Best known for her waning bowel control, Nicole is a 10th year BYU student and stay at home mom. Expectations for this fiesty underdog are low, but she hopes to prove doubters wrong by getting 4th or better. </p>
      <p class='hover-info' id='emily-info'> Going into her second year of law school Emily is this year's wild card. We know she is capable of being extremely dedicated and driven to achieve goals, however, we've also seen her show complete apathy towards fun and competition. Know one is quite sure what to expect from Emily this time out. </p>
      <p class='hover-info' id='tyson-info'> This will be Tyson's first Cluffathalon. Although inexperienced Tyson has quickly become a fan favorite and could be a dark horse to knock the crown off of Justin. All the locals will be rooting him. </p>
      <p class='hover-info' id='justin-info'> Last year's champion, Justin, takes a no nonsense approach to life. Just as comfortable in cowboy boots or spandex, Justin is this year's favorite to take it all. The experts can't see anything that will stop him from locking in and crushing the competition. </p>
      <p class='hover-info' id='ryan-info'> Ryan is a hungry up and comer. He fancies himself a title threat although recent performances have made critics doubt his dedication and coordination. His athletic shortcomings were on full display in March when he broke his ankle warming up in pole vault. Only Ryan expects a decent performance from himself this time around </p>
      <p class='hover-info' id='abby-info'> Abby exemplifies the 'I'm here so I don't get fined' approach to Cluffathalon. This lemonade conessuier is Vegas' favorite for last place, and she probably won't be too upset about it. </p>
